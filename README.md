- 👋 Hi, I’m @SnootBoopem
- 👀 I’m interested in trying to learn python to automate functions in action adventure survival games.  I play on private servers so no it wouldn't be cheating or affecting 100% human players.  My goal is to create first a bot which can automate funtions using something like pyautogui.  This is to get my avatar to max out stats like running, jumping, swimming etc while my server runs while I sleep.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python 3.9
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not sure yet hit me up if you got something interesting
- 📫 How to reach me is best done here.  I'm keeping my coding life for now just on this forum.
